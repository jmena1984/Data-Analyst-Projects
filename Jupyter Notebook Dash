The folowing will allow you to run a Dashboard in Jupyter notebooks

Later include this code in top cell 

!pip install dash==1.19.0  

!pip install jupyter_dash 

!pip install --upgrade plotly

import pandas as pd
import dash
import dash_html_components as html
import dash_core_components as dcc
from dash.dependencies import Input, Output
from jupyter_dash import JupyterDash
import plotly.graph_objects as go

Further you need to change 

app=dash.Dash(__name__)

as

app = JupyterDash(__name__)

Change your last line

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server()

as

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(port = 8090 ,dev_tools_ui=True, #debug=True,
              dev_tools_hot_reload =True, threaded=True)

This is the url of the spacex_launch_dash.csv

 dataset

https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DS0321EN-SkillsNetwork/datasets/spacex_launch_dash.csv

In the spacex_dash_app.py replace the line

spacex_df = pd.read_csv("spacex_launch_dash.csv")

as

spacex_df = pd.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DS0321EN-SkillsNetwork/datasets/spacex_launch_dash.csv")

Make these changes execute your code

Later in browser use the url

http://localhost:8090

Whenever you make changes to your code and want to rerun it  close the running instance, shutdown the kernel and restart the kernel and rerun the cells.
